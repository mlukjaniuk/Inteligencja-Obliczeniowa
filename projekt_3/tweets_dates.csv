페미니즘은 ‘여자는 치마를 입어야 한다’를
‘여자라고 치마를 입어야 하는 것은 아니다’로 인식을 바꾸는 것이지,
‘여자도 바지를 입어야 한다’라든지 ‘남자도 치마를 입어라’가 아니다.
치마를 입든 바지를 입든 그것이 여자든 남자든 전혀 문제 없고 상관 없는 것이 #페미니즘 이다. #feminism|2019-03-02

2) Feminism tells women they suck if they don't toe the  (masculinist) line &amp; follow men to the office. People will do anything - ANYTHING - for validation and #feminism only validates women who do what men do. So few women stand up against the source of validation.|2019-08-29

Question any identifying as a #Feminist: 

Re: Sexual #Objectification, what has #Feminism done to address women visually assessing a man in under 7 seconds without talking to him?
That denies his intrinsic humanity.
Preferences aside, that's dehumanizing &amp; objectifying.

When you beg for equality, you aren't equal. 
When you beg for something you already have, you're just stupid.

“ we need more men like President Kagame”. 

I stumbled upon this wonderful video today and wondered where I had been... to miss such a gem.

So grateful for women like Meghan Markle “creating her own table” (paraphrasing her)

What a time to be alive!

Act like a bitch @NPRKelly
Get treated like a bitch.
Your job title doesn't give you a pass to act like one.
No longer does your sex afford you such courtesy either

There is the equally you asked for.
Yippee for #Feminism

Women have to come out, roll their sleeves and grab their "equal opportunities" by themselves, not waiting for "men" to hand them those "opportunities" on a plate.

Real Men are now Feminists!

#Feminism|2020-01-26
Real Men are not scared of Feminism, rather I'll say, real men want women to put in the hardwork too, become independent, become "comrades" with your fellow sisters, support them, defend them,  finance them and vote for them.
#Feminism|2020-01-26
Women will rather fight to bring theirselves down due to petty competition and pure jealously for one another.

Women want equal rights from men, but also want to feel entitled to be treated specially by men also.

Ask yourself, how many women support each other, help each other financially and professionally, how many women would vote for one woman in an election? 
#Feminism|2020-01-26
If there are people truly scared of feminism, I'll say it's women. 

They want equal rights but run away from equal responsibility.

Citing #Islamic law, which stems from a specific narrative and reading of the Qur’an, some feminist scholars argue that Islam is directly opposed to gender equality. For them, no interpretation of the Qur’an can be reconciled with modern #feminism. https://t.co/pgKxMCtNNu|2020-03-26

@JohnDavisJDLLM The worst threat to a fake gender equality movement such as #feminism is the emergence of a real one.  #Feminists can't admit that this is what truly makes #MRAs so threatening to them, so they have to pretend that the MRM is full of mass shooters etc., and pretend to fear THAT.|2020-04-25

Apparently "#feminism" is being an ignorant git, gushing over Wallis Simpson &amp; Princess Margaret, just because they have a vagina. 
Stopped reading at "who also admitted to being a fan of The Crow" Of course she is. Another reason never to watch. #TheCrown

Bad things:
• the MSheU
• #feminism
• the minivan + the CUV/crossover (not actually invented by a woman, but invented specifically for women, so essentially the same thing)
• Indirect Female Competition
• Collective Group (herd/clique/safety in numbers) mentality
• the obsession with princesses/royalty (having hierarchical power + status + economic resources + nearly unlimited selection of mates…

#Feminism should be redefined as "standing for the traditional definition of woman".

That is: "An adult human female who can define woman". If you can't define it, you don't quality as one.

Men seek purity and innocents in a 
woman and we generally get that from younger women because they are less experienced.

We don’t want a women with a problematic past of trauma and bullshit.
